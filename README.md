This toolbox is for personal used or adacdemic use only . 
if you use it please cite the paper J. V. Manjon, P. Coup√©, A. Buades, D. L. Collins, M. Robles. New Methods for MRI Denoising based on Sparseness and Self-Similarity. Medical Image Analysis, 16(1): 18-27, 2012.

- Step 1 : Put the MRI denoising software in in the folder segmentation_utils
- Step 2 : In the folder Raw_data Inside "Raw_data," create subfolders for each phenotype.
 Within each phenotype's folder, create subfolders based on the date. The format chosen for the date should be  YYYYMMDD 
- Step 2 : In folder code run main.m
- Step 3 : The preprocess Raman image, and the single cell spectra  are saved in data folder
- Step 4 : Single cell spectra are plotted in folder figure
